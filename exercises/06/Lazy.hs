-- Quoting: <<EOQ
-- A note on evaluation order: the expression {seq a b} does not guarantee that {a} will be evaluated before {b}.
-- The only guarantee given by {seq} is that the both {a} and {b} will be evaluated before seq returns a value.
-- In particular, this means that {b} *may* be evaluated before {a}.
-- It also means that if you entirely ignore the result of {seq a b}, neither {a} nor {b} will be evaluated,
-- for example in {const 5 (seq undefined undefined)}.

-- TASK:
-- Let's consider the following problem:
-- We have a "circle" of n people. We have an integer k.
-- We repeat the following procedure, starting from the first person, until there is only one left:
--
-- "Kill" the kth person. Repeat this, "starting" from the k+1th person, i.e. we start indexing from the k+1th person.
--
-- Example execution for n = 5, k = 2:
-- 1 2 3 4 5 (start)
-- 1 2 4 5 (we kill 3, since 0 + 2 = 2)
-- 2 4 5 (we kill 1, since 4 + 2 = 6, circling back to 1)
-- 2 4
-- 4
--
-- The question is, given arguments n and k, what's the number of the final person left. (4 in the example above)
--
-- This is called the josephus problem - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem.
--
-- Your task is to implement {jos :: Integer -> Int -> Integer}
-- which takes n and k, and returns the last surviving person.
--
-- Your hint is to use `cycle` to express our circle, and then to drop and filter things from it.
